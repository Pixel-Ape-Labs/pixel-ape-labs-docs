### Required Permissions

The bot requires the following permissions in every channel that it will be used in:

- View Channel
- Use External Emoji
- Read Message History
- Use Application Commands

Due to a current bug with the Discord API, the **@everyone** role also needs **Use External Emoji** permissions in order for external emoji to work in all scenarios.
