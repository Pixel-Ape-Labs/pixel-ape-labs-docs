# What is Pixel Apes?

Pixel Apes is a big family of 3,534 Apes living in the Jungle of Solana! They are cool, collectible, and uniquely generated apes. We have a very chilled vibe within our community and we are here for the long term. We minted back in December of 2021 and we have a tight knit community who has weathered many storms together but we are stronger than ever. Come see for yourself.
